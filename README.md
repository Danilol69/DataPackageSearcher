# Discord Data Package Message Search

A simple python script that helps you search your messages in your Discord Data Package to find lost dms.

## How it works

This script looks for csv files that are in your messages folder in your Discord Data Package, these contain all the messages you have ever sent on Discord.

**Important Note:** Please do not send your Discord Data Package to others as it contains sensitive information about you and your account. You can learn more about it [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004957991).

3. Extract the contents of your Discord Data Package to a folder.
